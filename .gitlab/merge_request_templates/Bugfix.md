- [ ] Tests and linting passes.
- [ ] Update documentation. If you don't, tell us why.

Review and release process:

- [ ] This MR is based on `master` and is a MR to `master`.
- Code is reviewed
  - [ ] Front end code
  - [ ] Back end code
- [ ] Deployed to staging.
- [ ] Tested on staging by developer.

Okay, now you may merge.

Post-release process (perform the following steps directly on `master`):

- [ ] Summarise your changes in CHANGELOG.md under a new `## x.x+1` section.
- [ ] Add a 'comparison' line to show the diff for this release in CHANGELOG.md.
- [ ] Tag the merge commit (`git tag x.(x+1); git push --tags`)
- [ ] Merge `master` into `release`
