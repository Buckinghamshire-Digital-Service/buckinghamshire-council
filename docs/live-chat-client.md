# Live Chat Client

This is a front-end client provided by Click4Access. The only project code for this is hardcoded in the `base.html` template, and a boolean field to turn it on per-page at `bc.utils.models.BasePage`.

It sets cookies. See the [cookie documentation](cookies.md) about the project's approach to this.
