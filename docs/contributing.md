# Contributing

Before contributing to the open source project on GitHub, please consider that this project is opeen source but not collaborative.
The features it includes are specifically designed to the needs of the Buckinghamshire Council.

Feature submissions are unlikely to be included in the project, unless the feature is specifically desired by the council.
Bug fixes will be reviewed and included accoring to the [process described below](#how-to-deal-with-contributions).

## Repository Setup

Internal development happens on an internal GitLab instance.
A merge or push to the protetected `master` branch triggers a push to the open source GitHub repository.

No active development happens on GitHub itself.

The current setup was chosen to allow for open sourcing the repository without the need to migrate the whole CI setup from GitLab to GitHub.
This setup may be changed in the future to remove the need of managing two repositories.
