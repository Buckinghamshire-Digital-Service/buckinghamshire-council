# Buckinghamshire Council Technical Documentation

[TOC]

## Project overview

Buckinghamshire Council is a new unitary council formed from the five previous county and district councils in Buckinghamshire.

This project is primarily a CMS. During the initial phase, when the council is first inaugurated, it will serve a mixture of content written specially for the new council, and links to the previous councils' pages where services differ on a local basis.

Other features include:

- a job listings portal

To work on this project, see the README.

### External integrations

<!-- List here any external services this project uses. Preferably link to a separate documentation page for each. -->

The jobs portal will work with Lumesse. Please see the [recruitment site documentation](./recruitment_site.md) for details.

## Adding documentation

The navigational index of the documentation files is defined in the `mkdocs.yml` file. Add any new markdown files to that index. You can also link directly to files where necessary, using markdown formatting and relative URLs.
