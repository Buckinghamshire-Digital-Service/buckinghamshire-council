# Location maps widget

We use [Wagtail-Geo-Widget](https://github.com/Frojd/wagtail-geo-widget/) as a widget for location coordinates. It uses Google Maps internally.

## Configuration

Set the environment variables

- `GOOGLE_MAPS_V3_APIKEY` ([How to retrieve the api key](https://github.com/Frojd/wagtail-geo-widget/blob/main/docs/getting-started-with-google-maps.md#retriving-a-google-maps-api-key))

This variable is also used by the [location autocomplete widget](./location-autocomplete.md).
